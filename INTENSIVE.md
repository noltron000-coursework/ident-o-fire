# Senior Intensive Deliverable Proposal
> *Winter Intensive INT 2.2 2019*

- **My Name:** Nolan Kovacik
- **Project Name:** Fire? No Fire?
- **Project History:** New Project
- **Team Scope:** Solo Project

## Description
The fire/no-fire project should help me stretch my knowledge and skills in Data Science.
This intensive is a good opportunity for the reasons outlined below:
- it will make for a good portfolio item to display my skill set in data
- it will help me catch up in data science; last term I struggled a bit due to time restraints
- my jupyter notebooks are very clean, so the code will certainly look good
- there is an opportunity to expand and create a valuable medium article once this is done


### **Objective 1:** Determine whether input image contains flames.
1. Using neural networks, and a wide array of training images (which either contain fire or not), we can train the model to guess whether or not an image contains flames.
1. Furthermore, we can have a certain degree of error.
	Anything above 70% accuracy should be acceptable for this project.

### **Objective 2:** Use visualizations wherever possible.
1. This will help the codebase be more digestible by those who are not as tech-savvy.
1. Recruiters should be able to check the codebase, and learn about it in a glance.
1. The goal is to have 3&ndash;5 good visualizations that help describe the data or the code.

### **Objective 3:** Create a clean, readable jupyter notebook & readme
1. The jupyter notebook created from this project will be easily readable, and entirely reproducible by following markdown notes and inline comments.
1. Project will show a step-by-step process and thought pattern, with key terms and intentions defined along the way.
1. The README.md file should reflect this.
1. Whether this objective is completed or not should be determinable by any peer who reads over the jupyter notebook.
1. `STRETCH:` Write a medium article to articulate steps done in this process.
